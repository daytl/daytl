Just paste your JWT into the text box and press 'Decode'.       The tool will immediately display the decoded parts of the token, such as the header and payload. Importantly, decryption takes place locally on your device, ensuring that your data remains yours and never leaves your browser</p> <h2>Security Warning</h2> <p>Although our tool ensures that JWT decryption takes place locally and your data is not shared, it is important to exercise caution when handling JWTs. Never share your JWT if it contains sensitive information, nor store it in unsecured locations. Always use HTTPS to communicate and secure your tokens.</p>",
